Granary/Warpath Style
Cap all 5 points in sequence.  Locked points may not be capped.

BLU and RED have once again discovered each others' clandestine
bases, coincidentally located directly nextdoor to one another!
Defeat your colorfully clad opponents and take their base by 
force lest ye have yours taken first!
